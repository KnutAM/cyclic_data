Description of experiments
***************************

#. Add predeformation end data and refer to full data set on Mendeley
   data. Note the sign reversal! The data included should be corrected
   wrt. torsional sign
   
   * The strains after each predeformation level (PD1,3,6)
   * The Hill yield surfaces after each predeformation level (PD1,3,6)

#. Correct sign in hdf5 data file
#. Change load angle definition in hdf5 data file 
#. Change initial dir angle in "description" field

Predeformation experiments
==========================
The full data for one predeformation experiment is available as
a `dataset <https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/sjsyw6cmfd/2>`_. 
Note that in this dataset, the torque, and rotations are reversed
compared to the definitions above.


Cyclic data
============
Describe structure and fields of hdf5 data.
